    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Irish tea cake is a simple butter cake that's great with tea or coffee. It's easy to make, pretty, and very delicious.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round pan.</li>
        <li>Cream sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing until fully incorporated after each addition. Stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir dry ingredients into wet ingredients alternately with milk, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk if batter is too stiff. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a serving plate and cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar right before serving.</li>
    </ol>
